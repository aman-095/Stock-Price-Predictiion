# Stock Price Prediction

Using the google stock prices dataset and build a model to predict the future prices using previous instances. A pipeline is also developed through which allows continuous predictions taking the present data itself and generating the future estimated stock prices.


## Tools Required

**Scikit Learn:** ML Library used

**Matplotlib:** Data Visualization

**Tensorflow:** Deep Learning Models

**Pandas:** Python data manipulation libraries

**Numpy:** Working with data in form of arrays






## Roadmap

1. [Stock Price Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/aman-095/Stock-Price-Predictiion/blob/main/Stock_Price_Prediction%20(1).ipynb)
This is the main file with all the preprocessing, various Machine learning, Deep Learning Models and a real-time Pipeline.

- Installing libraries and dependency
- Importing the dataset - [Google Stock Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhupendersharma999/google-stock-price-prediction-rnn/data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation
- Data Preprocessing - Basic preprocessing and structuring the dataset
- Dividing the dataset into train and test
- Applying Machine Learning models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Light GBM Regressor
- XG Boost Regressor
- Applying Deep Learning models
- Pipeline developed with the best model for future predictions with the real time data
2. [Report Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/aman-095/Stock-Price-Predictiion/blob/main/Report_Stock%20Price%20Prediction.pdf)
This contains all the qualitative analysis of the results and detailed data visualization.
